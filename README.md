# PiCross #
The thing is... I wanted to make a PiCross game that works easy, because the ones
I found online wasn't exactly that.

The roadmap includes a digitalocean instance, some work on the styles, and being
able to play maps bigger than 5x5 (the logic is the same, but, you now, I may have
hardcoded the 5's somewhere...).

## Instalation ##
Clone the repo, open your favorite browser (firefox *cough* *cough*), and open
the index.html file. Voila!

## Instructions ##
Click on a square to mark it as valid, or shift-click on a square to mark it as not valid

## Future enchancements ##
Drag to paint different squares with the same click.
Put some style on it (for god's sake).
